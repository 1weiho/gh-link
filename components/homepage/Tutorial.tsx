        <Paragraph>
          GH Link is a Link in Bio website that can be configured with only a
          JSON file.This makes it incredibly easy to set up and customize your
          Link in Bio page without having to create an account on a platform.
          Simply create a JSON file with your desired configuration and upload
          it to your personal GitHub repository. Your Link in Bio page will then
          be ready to go.
